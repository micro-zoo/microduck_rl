"""Microduck DANCE task — beat-conditioned dancing on flat ground.

The policy dances on the spot to a sampled beat: a DanceCommand term drives the
6D "body_pose" command slot with [sin(φ/2), cos(φ/2), tempo_norm, move 3-bit id]
(0 squat_bounce / 1 weight_shift / 2 head_bob / 3 climax / 4 call_out)
(see the DANCE section header in mdp.py for the exact mapping — the 13D command
block layout [twist(3), head_pose(4), body_pose(6)] is UNCHANGED, so the 61D
obs contract and runtime policy hot-swap still hold).

Five procedural moves, all referenced analytically from the beat phase:
  0 squat_bounce  — trunk z dips 4.8 cm sinusoidally, lowest point ON the beat
  1 weight_shift  — trunk roll ±16°, period 2 beats, hip_roll joint reference
  2 head_bob      — head_pitch nods ±30° at 2× the beat frequency
  3 climax        — simultaneous squat, weight shift, nod, and head yaw
  4 call_out      — sustained head-up pose with a slow body sway

Built on make_microduck_velocity_env_cfg() so DR / obs noise / delays / NaN
guards / BAM friction plumbing come for free; the walking-specific terms are
then re-tuned or removed:

  - twist(3) keeps its velocity semantics but with TINY ranges (this task is
    danced in place; the slots stay alive for later spin/step_touch moves)
  - head_pose(4) keeps its semantics with the small initial ranges (no widening
    curriculum); head_bob's reference nod is carried by dance_joint_tracking,
    not by the head_pose slot
  - gait terms removed (air_time, foot_clearance, foot_swing_height): the feet
    stay planted; no_stepping_penalty enforces that
  - motion-blocker regularizers lowered vs walking (dance is dynamic):
    body_ang_vel -0.05 → -0.01, angular_momentum -0.02 → -0.005
  - pose regularizer loosened (weight 1.0 → 0.25, standing std = walking std):
    squatting/rolling must move the legs away from HOME without fighting a
    tight standing pose
  - head_pose_tracking 2.0 → 0.3 (slot alive; the bob reference at weight 1.0
    wins for move 2 — for moves 0/1 the head stays near the ~neutral command)
  - the velocity env's body_pose_tracking_6d infra is REMOVED: its semantics
    (6D pose deltas) clash with the dance command mapping on the same slot
  - action_rate ramps only to -0.6 (rhythmic motion is smoother-taxable but
    must not be blocked)
